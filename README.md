#pliskin-learns-git

I updated this file in a locally created repo that is linked to this github repo.
This is my first commit-push operation from a locally created git repo!

This should appear in my working directory if pull is successful.

I was able to pull the latest version!

I updated this from [branch1]!
I added line separators to better distinguish each commit in the file.
This is my first time to branch a master repo!

I noticed that the line separators added some unexpected text formatting.
They turned most of these sentences into subheadings.
I didn't like what it looked like so I removed them after merging branch1 with master.

I just deleted [branch1]! I think I've got the basics down! 
\(^_^)/~~~ Weee!

I just created a tag named 1.0.0_Basics. 
This serves as a milestone marker for me after learning the basics of git.
I will update this repo again when I learn more advanced operations.
